# My blog

Please check out [Jingyang's Blog](https://zjysteven.github.io/blog/).

This blog is set up with [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## The theme

The theme of my blog is [NexT v5.1.4](https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next). I further customize it by learning from reuixiy(一休儿)'s fantastic [blog](https://reuixiy.github.io) and his/her [tutorial](https://reuixiy.github.io/technology/computer/computer-aided-art/2017/06/09/hexo-next-optimization.html) (written in Chinese).

## Useful tips

If you are a beginner like me and want to build a blog with Hexo and NexT, here are some "How to start" tips from my end.

1. Check out [Hexo's documentation](https://hexo.io) to get familiar it. There are only a few frequently-used commands and should be easy to follow. Then you can start by initializing a blog and deploying it onto Github.
2. Check out NexT's documentation at either [here](https://theme-next.org/docs/getting-started/) (for latest v7 with more features, written in English) or [here](http://theme-next.iissnan.com/getting-started.html) (only for v5 or earlier, written in Chinese). Then you can modify the theme configuration file to make your blog more powerful. You can also take a look at detailed tutorials made by [Dragonstyle](http://www.dragonstyle.win/3358042383.html#more) and [simon96](https://www.simon96.online/2018/10/12/hexo-tutorial/) (both written in Chinese).
3. Then comes the step of customization. Basically, you need to add codes to `your_blog/themes/next/source/css/_custom/custom.styl` to customize your theme. It will override the default style set by other `.styl` files. This is pretty awesome as you can change back to default theme whenever you want by emptying `custom.styl`. You can check out [reuixiy's tutorial](https://reuixiy.github.io/technology/computer/computer-aided-art/2017/06/09/hexo-next-optimization.html) and [masteranthoneyd's source code](https://github.com/masteranthoneyd/blog) for more information. You might also need to make a few modifications to `.swig` files to change the layout. Prior knowledge of HTML and CSS is very helpful for the whole customization process.
